Looking at this data, we can tell Rural community has the high average fare per ride and average fare per driver compared to other two communities. Even though Urban and Suburban had more total rides and drivers still rural was on top. However, when you look athe total fares, urban was on top. Urban earned $ 39854.38 compared the other 2 communities.

Summary:

Based on this analysis and looking at those data I provided on top, I would recommend increasing the drivers in rural community because rural has very less drivers but they are making more money per ride than the other two communities. I think by adding more drivers it can increase more rides and more total fares.
